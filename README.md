## Requests (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate or **D**elete)
We could make **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate or **D**elete with this database. All possibilities are listed [here](./assets/docs/requests.md).

---


## Execution

> 1 - Create a database name '**airline_reservation**' (enter the password of **YOUR** database. Instruction in this file [here](https://github.com/DinhLeGaulois2/sql_react_redux_courses_organizer/blob/master/server/models/index.js)).<br/>
> 2 - Execute (on the application's **root** folder): **npm install** (to install **dependencies**)<br/>
> 3 - Execute (on the application's **root** folder): **npm run build** (to run the **server**)<br/>
> 4 - Open your web browser (***Firefox***, ***Chrome***, etc.) then, enter: **localhost:3000**<br/>


---

## Configuration (VERY IMPORTANT)

At the project's root folder, we have a file name "**server.js**" ([here](https://github.com/DinhLeGaulois2/sql_react_redux_courses_organizer/blob/master/server.js)), by the end, we have:

It's very important to follow the instruction, otherwise, you could have very disappointed surprises ...

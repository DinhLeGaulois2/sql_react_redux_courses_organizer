# Courses Organizer

## Aim
Building a project based on an EER (Enhanced Entity-Relationship). The goal is to learn to build project base on someone's idea, which is much more difficult than with ours.

> This project is one of about 30-35 others building by mixing:
>   * Front-End: **jQuery**, **ReactJS**, **React-Redux**, **Angular** (2-5), **Ionic3**, **View.js**
>   * Back-End: 5 APIs (2 with **MongoDB** and 3 with **SQL**)
> 
> These are **3-tier Architecture** projects. Everything is started (almost) from scratch (the diagrams for the databases come from the Internet - with link to to source on each picture - with errors which were fixed)
>
> The **Front-End** are NOT the most beautiful because not much work on it. The goal is to use very different technologies on very different purposes.

> This application allows a school's department to manage its courses taking care of all relationship between: 
>  * **instructors**
>  * **students** (**grade**)
>  * **courses** (**online**, **onsite** with schedule, place and time)

We could make **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate or **D**elete with this database. All possibilities are listed [here](./assets/docs/requests.md).

> 2 - Execute (on the application's **root** folder): **npm install** (to install **dependencies**)<br/>
> 3 - Execute (on the application's **root** folder): **npm run build** (to run the **server**)<br/>
> 4 - Open your web browser (***Firefox***, ***Chrome***, etc.) then, enter: **localhost:3000**<br/>

## Configuration (VERY IMPORTANT)

At the project's root folder, we have a file name "**server.js**" ([here](https://github.com/DinhLeGaulois2/sql_react_redux_courses_organizer/blob/master/server.js)), by the end, we have:

It's very important to follow the instruction, otherwise, you could have very disappointed surprises ...
